## Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future: The Ingenious Ideas That Drive Today's Computers. John MacCormick

This is a book I picked up a few months ago. I have decided to read through it, and create projects for each of the nine algorithms. 

I'm not sure how the structure of all this will work, but this will be the overall directory for this heaping project. 

## What defines an algorithm in this case? 
    "The first criterion- everyday use by ordinary computer users- eliminates algorithms used primarily by computer professionals, such as compilers and program verification techniques. The second criterion- concrete application to a specific problem - eliminates many of the great algorithms that are central to the undergraduate computer science curriculum. This includes sorting algorithms like quicksort, graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm, and data structures such as hash tables. These algorithms are indisputably great and they easily meet the first criterion, since most application programs run by ordinary users employ them repeatedly. But these algorithms are generic: they can be applied to a vast array of different problems. In this book, I have chosen to focus on algorithms for specific problems, since they have a clearer motivation for ordinary copmuter users."
